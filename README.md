# MacroPad
A python script that takes over the numpad turning it into a automation machine. This script
will be updated frequently as it is used daily by me for easier navigation.

# Summary of Changes To Numpad
- MacroPad can be turned on using the ScrollLock as a toggle
- When MacroPad is off, it will behave exactly like a NumPad
- When the MacroPad is on, switching on or off the Numpad will cause MacroPad to go to a different `page`
  - A page is basically an alternate set of actions that the same key can do. Think of it like a Toggle Shift for Macros
  - One example is that when the MacroPad is On and Numpad is Off, The NumpadPlus key does one thing, whereas if the
  MacroPad is On and Numpad is also On, then it acts as a VolumeUp button.


# Requirements
- Python 3.9+
